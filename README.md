TextAdventure-Base
==================

An example that offers ideas on how to get started with a JavaScript-based HTML5 text adventure game.
Game Name: Infiltrator
The game will open up with a name creation phase which will put the players name throughout the dialog. The player will wake up
to the beeping of a laptop and it will alert him of a new contract. Im hoping to have the game represent a hitman type game that you will need to navigate buildings succesfully to get your target. There will be henchmen who will be easier enemies and there will be a mob boss at the end of the game. The mob boss will either drop information to tell you about your past or give you information leading to your family depending on which way I want to go for back story. The player will be able to move, peak, distract, and pick up various items. I would like my game to be more spy like where words and passphrases allow the player to accomplish his goals


Authors Note: The game description is much different than the finished game! Functions have changed and game outcome but since it is finished you can see for yourself :)
